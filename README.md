    How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I can ensure that my code is functional and secure by following the requirements closely, as well as doing software testing during every step of the way. One way of keeping my code secure that I will deploy is automation testing, which proves to better code functionality and security.
    
    How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I interpret user needs by allowing the user to submit feedback and suggestions, which I can then incorporate. Allowing for the user to have a voice in my programming can help me understand exactly what the user needs.

    How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software with an open mind, anything is possible as long as it is reasonable. First by gathering the requirements, I can then understand exactly what is need from me and the software. Then, I can start to brainstorm on how the software will look and how it must function. Along the way, I will allow for the client/user to addd their input and voice their problems, thus ensuring that the software I am designing is up to their standards.
